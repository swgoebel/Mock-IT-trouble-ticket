# Mock-IT-trouble-ticket

This is a group school project that involved creating a mock IT trouble ticket system.
I handled the code that accessed the database. This can be seen in the PHP files particularly in the [create ticket](https://github.com/swgoebel/Mock-IT-trouble-ticket/blob/master/createticket.php), [report results] (https://github.com/swgoebel/Mock-IT-trouble-ticket/blob/master/reportresults.php), and [get ticket](https://github.com/swgoebel/Mock-IT-trouble-ticket/blob/master/getticket.php) pages.

The website is inaccesable because the server that stored the database was taken down.
